# imsa-admission-data
This repo contains admissions data and any subsequent analysis from the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy as retrieved by a FOIA request.

## foia-correspondence
This includes the important correspondence I had with IMSA's FOIA Officer, including the initial FOIA request. It is all dated.

## raw-excel-files
These are the original Excel files given to me by IMSA's FOIA Officer. I include them here only for posterity. I **will not** merge any pull requests to this folder. 

## usable-datasets
This folder includes the three separate datasets that IMSA sent me, all in `CSV` format. All commits should be made here. The names of the datasets explain what they contain. Generally, stuff that IMSA provided me (converted to `CSV` from `XLSX`) is called "raw-data" while data with alterations is called "cleaned-data".

## License
Since this data was retreived via a Freedom of Information Act Request, it seems only right to open source the data to eliminate the need for another FOIA. To be clear, you may alter, analyze and reproduce this data at your leisure. Additionally, all software in this project (as of this writing, none) is licensed under the MIT License.
