# imsa-admission-data
This repo contains admissions data and any subsequent analysis from the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy as retrieved by a FOIA request.

## foia-correspondence
This includes the important correspondence I had with IMSA's FOIA Officer, including the initial FOIA request.

## demographic-only-no-rejects-data

This contains the initial data provided to me by IMSA (and any subsequent analysis). This dataset does not include rejected applicants nor does it include GPA or SAT scores.

### raw-data
This is simply the spreadsheet IMSA provided to me (except it was converted from `.XLSX` to `.CSV`).
### cleaned-data
Here is where any alterations to the dataset to make it machine readable or generally more useful will happen

## License
Since this data was retreived via a Freedom of Information Act Request, it seems only right to open source the data to eliminate the need for another FOIA. To be clear, you may alter, analyze and reproduce this data at your leisure. Additionally, all software in this project (as of this writing, none) is licensed under the MIT License.
