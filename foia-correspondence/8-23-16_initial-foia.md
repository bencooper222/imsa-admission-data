Dear Freedom of Information Officer:

Pursuant to Illinois's Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140 (), I hereby request the following records:

Documents containing demographic data of applicants to the residential institution (as defined in 105 ILCS 305/2, Ch. 122, par. 1503-2). The data should include but not be limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sex, economic status and location and should be broken down by admitted status (i.e. admitted but not attending, admitted and attending, or rejected). A student by student (anonymized) breakdown and a contingency table would be preferable. 

Under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, 5 ILCS 140 the government is allowed to charge only the cost of copying materials. I am requesting that you waive all applicable fees associated with this request as I believe this request is in the public interest as the public deserves to know who are the beneficiaries of state funds. This request is not for commercial use. Release of this information is in the public interest because it will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations and activities. If you deny this request for a fee waiver, please advise me in advance of the estimated charges associated with fulfilling this request. Please send me a detailed and itemized explanation of those charges.

In the interest of expediency, and to minimize the research and/or duplication burden on your staff, please send records electronically if possible. If this is not possible, please notify me before sending to the address listed below.

Please contact me via email if you have any questions about my request.

Sincerely,

Benjamin Cooper
